## About

QVRWeekView is a work in progress framework that contains a week/day view that allows you to display, add and remove events.

### Features

* Horizontal and vertical scrolling
* Infinite horizontal scrolling
* Zooming
* Colour, size and font customization features
* Day and hour label font resizing
* Dynamic event adding and removing
* Event tap, long press and event request callbacks
* Number of visible days customizable

### Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.
Most useful example code can be found in `Example > QVRWeekView > CalendarViewController or StartViewController`

### Requirements

This pod requires a minimum deployment target of iOS 9.0.

### Installation

QVRWeekView is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "QVRWeekView"
```

## Usage

### Setup

Once the framework is installed, there are two ways you can incorporate the `WeekView` into your project:

#### 1. Programatically

To add the WeekView programatically, simply import `QVRWeekView` into your code by adding:
```ruby
import QVRWeekView
```
at the top of your source file containing your view controller.
Then insert the WeekView into your view controller by adding:
```ruby
let weekView = WeekView(frame: self.view.frame)
self.view.addSubview(weekView)
```
into either your viewDidLoad or viewWillAppear method.

#### 2. Via the storyboard

To add the `WeekView` via the storyboard, simply add a View onto your View Controller and resize it or add constraints. Then go to the identity inspector of your view and select the Class to be `WeekView` and the module to be `QVRWeekView` (See image).

Then you should be all set!

### Working with WeekView

#### WeekView Delegate

`WeekView` has a delegate called `WeekViewDelegate`. For now this delegate contains only three functions:

| Function                            | Parameters                                                                             | Behaviour                                                             | Recommended use                                                     |
| ------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| didLongPressDayView      | weekView:`WeekView`, date:`Date`                                       | Called when a dayView column is long pressed. The passed `date` contains which time point was pressed | Use this function to add individual user events           |
| didTapEvent                      | weekView:`WeekView`, eventId:`Int`                                    | Called when an event is tapped. `eventId` of the tapped event is passed                           | Use this function to prompt event editing or removal |
| loadNewEvents                 | weekView:`WeekView`, startDate:`Date` , endDate:`Date`  | Called when events are ready to be loaded. `startDate` and `endDate` indicate (inclusively) between which two dates events are required.  | Use this function to load in stored events                   |

#### WeekView Public functions

| Function                            | Parameters                           | Behaviour                                                             |
| ------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| updateTimeDisplayed       | `\`                                         | Updates the time displayed by the hour indicator |
| showDay                           | date:`Date`                           | Scrolls the week view to the day passed by `date`  |
| showToday                        | `\`                                         | Scrolls the week view to today                              |
| loadEvents                        | eventsData:`[EventData]` | Loads, processes and displays the events provided by the `eventsData` array of `EventData`<sup>1</sup> objects.         |

#### EventData<sup>1</sup>

EventData is the main object used to communicate events between the WeekView and your code. EventData can be overriden.

| Variable/Function            | Purpose                           |
| ----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| id:`String`                    | A unique identifier for this event |
| title:`String`                 | A title that will be displayed for this event|
| startDate:`Date`            |  The start date for this event |
| endDate:`Date`              | The end date for this event |
| color:`UIColor`              | The main color for this event  |
| allDay:`Bool`                  | Indicates if this event is an all day event, all day events are displayed along the top bar |
| configureGradient()       | Used to configure a gradient that will be used to render your event instead of just a solid color |

## How it works

The main WeekView view is a subclass of UIView. The view layout is retrieved from the WeekView xib file. WeekView contains a top and side bar sub view. The side bar contains an HourSideBarView which displays the hours. WeekView also contains a DayScrollView (UIScrollView subclass) which controls vertical scrolling and also delegates and contains a DayCollectionView (UICollectionView subclass) which controls the horizontal scrolling. DayCollectionView cells are DayViewCells, whose view is generated programtically (due to inefficiencies caused by auto-layout).

WeekView handles all top level operations such as pinch gestures and orientation change. Scrolling of the top and side bar is handled by a function inside of WeekView which is called by the DayScrollView when scrolling. Top bar day labels are generated, displayed and discarded simulaneously with DayCollectionView cells by the WeekView.
